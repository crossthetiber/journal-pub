This volume of *Fresh Writing* continues a tradition set in motion by Dr. Connie Snyder Mick in 2000, when she initiated the Fresh Writing project in collaboration with Dr. John Duffy, Frances O’Malley Director of the University Writing Program. Their vision was to provide a publication venue for some of the most outstanding writing done by students in the first year of their studies at Notre Dame. Now in its 13th year of publication, *Fresh Writing* continues to showcase the excellent work of first-year students. We are grateful to both Dr. Mick and Dr. Duffy for their vision and continued support of the project.

We owe our deepest debt of thanks to our contributors for sharing their work with the Notre Dame community. We also thank those professors whose students’ work appears in this volume: Jeff Bain-Conkin, Dr. Julie Bruneau, Dr. Eileen Hunt Botting, Elizabeth Capdevielle, Dr. Erin Dietel-McLaughlin, Dr. Margaret Doody, Emily Gandolfi, Monika Grzesiak, Ed Kelly, Dr. David Ladouceur, Angel Matos, Melissa McCoul, Dr. Annie McGowan, Meagan Simpson, and Dr. Maryam Zomorodian. Thanks are also due to all who submitted essays for consideration for publication and to their professors for guiding them in work that is truly first-rate.

Our Editorial Board is charged with the very difficult task of choosing a select few essays for publication from among a large number of excellent submissions. For their care and diligence in closely reading each submission, we thank Anthony Abordo, Elizabeth Capdevielle, Dr. Patrick Clauss, Dr. Erin Dietel-McLaughlin, John Dillon, Dr. Elizabeth Evans, Shannon Hagedorn, Marielle Hampe, Diego Lopez, Nicole MacLaughlin, Sheila McCarthy, Elizabeth Van Jacob, Leandra Wolf, and Dr. Maryam Zomorodian. We extend special thanks to the Snite Museum Essay Competition Committee, Bridget Hoyt and Dr. Essaka Joshua.

We thank Terri O’Bryan, Administrative Assistant in the University Writing Program, for her support throughout this and all other projects on which we’ve had the good fortune to collaborate.

I also offer my personal thanks to Lisa Wess, Senior Managing Editor at HaydenMcNeil, for her seemingly infinite patience and good cheer and her expert guidance throughout the *Fresh Writing* project. Thanks also to Liz LaFortune and Eric Dean Hageman for their help with our cover art.

Finally, many thanks go to our Assistant Editor Ricky Bevington for his work on this volume, both before and after his graduation. It has been an honor to work closely with such a fine thinker and writer.

Enjoy this year’s *Fresh Writing*!
