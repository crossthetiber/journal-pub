## Foreword

From the Assistant Editor:

This is a book about superpowers. Okay, it’s actually about writing, but aren’t those essentially the same thing?

To compare effective writing to a superpower might seem melodramatic at first. When we think of superpowers we think of things spectacular, outlandish, and superhuman. Things like flying and guaranteed laughs at every joke top the list for many. But writing? I can just hear you now: “Everyone can write! There is nothing enchanted about that.”

I admit, when composing a five-paragraph essay for a banal prompt on a standardized test or a painfully constraining assignment in a high school English class, few feel like what they are doing is fantastical. You write exactly what someone, usually a teacher, tells you to write. Like in math, you follow the steps to find the answer, but rather than numbers and operations, writing prompts require words and punctuation.

Though at times completing assignments in *Writing and Rhetoric* and your University Seminar may feel like nothing more than repeating the motions of high school, I would like to suggest that writing in college is different from those formulaic essays of a time past. No longer are you filling in the blanks trying to tell someone what they want to hear. You have reached a point at which you can create ideas that no one else has conceived before. You think, feel, and believe things that are unique to you, and when put down on paper, these ideas can be shared with your professors, friends, and the world. Yes, you will be given guidelines and suggestions as to how to communicate your ideas, but these are merely the tools to refine your newly acquired superpower: the *rhetorical superpower*.

The first year at Notre Dame is a time of discerning the details of your identity: who you are, what you stand for, and what taking that stand means for your future. Notre Dame is a place where both in the classroom and with your friends you are free to explore what you genuinely think, feel, and believe. The recognition of these parts of your identity is what gives you a voice: a voice that begs to be shared as it grows and matures. But finding the right words, the right sentences, the right phrasing, punctuation, and structure to convince another of the integrity of your thoughts is no easy task. To be honest, to do all of this is nothing short of a miracle, but interestingly a near miracle that is done every day.

This thirteenth edition of *Fresh Writing* contains the voices of 21 students and the ideas they have boldly put on paper for others to read, scrutinize, consider, and discuss. Though I have not personally met each of these writers, just from reading their writing, I and the members of the editorial board recognize how significant the ideas contained within this text are to their respective authors. We can also feel in the writing their strong desire to communicate that significance with their reader. This desire—the desire to share the depth, intricacy, beauty, and value of an idea—directs itself toward a goal that seems simultaneously simplistic and unattainable.

“It seemed good to me...to write an orderly account” says Saint Luke as he introduces his Gospel. The words and ideas we as students share may pale in comparison to the work of Saint Luke. But for us, it, too, is good—fitting—to share the most human thing we have, our ideas, with others. Taking something that is immaterial, created only by us, and, through the vehicle of writing, create the same idea in another’s mind, that is something as magical, as fantastical, and possibly even as divine as one could ever hope to do. No matter the topic, whether folk metal, beauty in art, or nuclear energy, it is crucial that you capture the thought and allow others to access not only the idea but also the *you-ness* inherent within it. That is what our Fresh Writing authors have done. They viewed their first year writing courses both as an opportunity to sharpen their rhetorical skill, and also as an opportunity to release the new voice they were beginning to discover. And in doing that they challenge you to do the same. Use your superpower.
